#Snowy Terminal
## About
This is a short demo that just uses vanilla Python. It lets the user choose rain or snow, a speed
and a frequency. Then it shows a simulation in the terminal.  Snow builds up over time, but
rain just disappears.
## How to Use
Download snow.py or clone the repository, then, in the download directory,  run  
```python3 snow.py```
